Polynomial Math
===============

Requirements
------------

Polynomial Math is designed to compile on a Linux/Unix-compatible system. All development was done in Mac OS X.


Purpose
-------

This project was written to fulfill an assignment for my Data Structures course. 
It consists of a command-line interface for performing addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and modulus with two polynomials; for raising a polynomial to an 
exponent; and for evaluating a polynomial by assigning a value to its variable.


How to Use It
-------------

First you must compile the program. Simply navigate to the project directory 
via the command line and run 'make'. When complete, you can then run the 
resulting 'poly' executable.

Polynomials should be formatted like this:

3x^4 + 2x^3 + -5x + 1

It is important to note that, rather than notating subtraction of a positive 
coefficient (such as 2x^3-5x), you must notate addition of a negative 
coefficient. Also, please be sure to enter terms from greatest power to least.


Why am I Proud of This Project?
-------------------------------

Despite the notational limitations described in the previous section, this 
project fulfilled the assignment and earned a perfect grade. Creating it gave me 
a glimpse of the power of computers to easily handle complex tasks that are far 
more challenging and/or time-consuming for humans.
